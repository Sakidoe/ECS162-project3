- What AI tool did you use?

For this project, we used ChatGPT to debug and understand the issues we came across, to find work arounds and the reasonings to the issues.

- How did you use it? What kind of questions did you ask? (include links to your conversation if applicable)

For this project, there were a lot of kinks to figure out when transitioning from a .html project to a .svelte project. Within Richard's hw 1 code,
he used a lot of custom ::after .css code to create margins between the bottom barrier, and the side barriers of grids. That did not translate at all 
and GPT was used to find a workaround. Another instance was porting the .html code into the .svelte code, using ChatGPT we were able to find this method:
function panelClass(i: number) {
    return ['tl','tm','tr','bl','bm','br'][i] + '-panel';
  }
to drastically condense our code, so that individual html panels did not have to be made. Overall, we asked questions like "why is the api supposedly running, 
but nothing is loading?" and other related questions to understand the behavior of the backend as well.

- How much did it help you? How helpful and accurate was it?

We asked it a lot of debugging questions, which cut down our debugging time by a lot. That was the most significant help it was able to give us.
