- What AI tool did you use?

For this project, we used ChatGPT to mainly learn more about debugging and different ways we could implement unit tests that cover more code,
as well as using asking it a lot of clarifying questions, and debugging merging mongodb code with api code. It was also very helpful with traversing
through the issues we faced while creating the commenting system.

- How did you use it? What kind of questions did you ask? (include links to your conversation if applicable)

For this project, one of the hardest things to understand was the commenting system. From finding how to use MongoCompass to how to
debugging flask routes, we used it in a very theoretical sense as these were all new languages and systems for us.
Specifically it helped us get this json structure:
return jsonify([
        {
            "_id": str(c["_id"]),
            "username": c["username"],
            "content": c["content"],
            # This gets the parent ID, for some reason c["parent_id"] doesnt work
            "parent_id": str(c["parent_id"]) if c.get("parent_id") else None,
            "role": c.get("role", "user")
        }
        for c in comment_list
    ])
Which became instrumental in layering comments and it's replies. The parent_id was very buggy when used just like username
- How much did it help you? How helpful and accurate was it?

We asked it a lot of debugging questions, which cut down our debugging time by a lot. It was also very
useful for finding the solution to very peculiar bugs that had non-descriptive errors in them.
That was the most significant help it was able to give us.
